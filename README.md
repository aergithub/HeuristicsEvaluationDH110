# UX Design of Content-Sharing Applications

## Andrea Robinson, DH 110: User Experience and Design

Project Description: I am conducting a heuristic evaluation of two websites designed for information storing and sharing. My project is aimed to connect generations through the information they consume: the videos they watch, the music they listen to, the articles they read. The purpose of the application is for those within a selected community, family, or group to be able to share the content they're engaging with without having to directly inform each person. 

## Website #1: [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/home?src=navbar)

**Brief Description:** This is the website of a web and mobile application “Pocket,” an application dedicated to empowering individuals to “keep their minds focused, stimulated, and nourished” through a collection of digital articles and the ability to curate digital articles and links in your personal digital library. This is done through either an input of an independent URL with plus icon at the top of the webpage, or by scrolling through Pocket’s collections and discover page for articles of interest. There are four different sections to navigate through, “home,” “saves,” “discover,” and “collections.” 

**Overall evaluation:** The website satisfies the minimal requirements for easy navigation through the application. Some tabs, like “saves” “articles” “favorites” “highlights” “collections” and “videos” can seem redundant or unclear as to their purpose upon first navigation but as you test out adding links to your saved collection the distinction between the tabs becomes clearer. 

## Heuristic Evaluation

**Heuristic #1:** *Visibility of system status.* All of the links (articles, videos, songs, etc.) are visible within the “saves” tab which you can easily navigate to through three lines in the left-hand corner. However, the tags, words in which you can categorize articles by, are not visible on the article’s symbol. Additionally, when you navigate to the “all tags,” only the tag (as a word) is pictured for you to navigate through, rather than sample images of what articles you’ve saved to each tab. **Severity rating: 2.**

**Heuristic #2:** *Match between system and the real world.* There is an option to “recommend” an article with commentary, only visible when you click to share an article. There is no visible clue as to where the recommendations go or who is able to view the recommendation. **Severity rating: 2.**

**Heuristic #3:** *User control and freedom.* With the exception of archiving an article, which I consider to best fall under the heuristic “error prevention,” the website does a good job of allowing users to be in control of their navigation. All articles that are associated with an external link open as another page rather than replacing the website, the “save” button at the bottom of each article you navigate through on the website can also be used to unsave links/articles. If you delete an article from your saves, a notification that you have just deleted the article alongside an “undo” button shows up in green in the left-hand bottom corner of the web page. The “favorite” button when you navigate through your saved articles also can be used as an “un-favorite” button once it has been added to your favorites. Any highlights can easily be removed via a pop-up three-dot icon, or re-highlighted by using your mouse to highlight the text. **Severity rating: 0.**

**Heuristic #4:** *Consistency and standards.* All tabs and symbols appear to follow their typical structure. A navigation bar becomes visible when you click on three lines in the top left-hand corner. Each tab of the navigation bar is accompanied by a symbol that is commonly associated with the words/phrases: discover, a compass, also used for the search platform Safari, home, a house, favorites, a star, highlights, a highlighter, and so forth. A small circle with your photo in the right-hand corner allows you to navigate through account settings, and a search bar, plus sign, and pencil symbol indicate the “search” tool, uploading a link to your saves, and editing en masse, respectively. **Severity rating: 0.**

**Heuristic #5:** *Error prevention.* If you were to accidentally archive an article, there is no “undo” button associated with the action nor is there a confirmation of the action. You have to navigate from the “saves” tab to the “archive” tab in order to add the article back to saves. **Severity rating: 1.**

**Heuristic #6:** *Recognition rather than recall.* While the four main tabs make it easy to navigate between the basic functions of the web/mobile application, there is an aspect of engaging with the article that one has to navigate through several steps before the option is visible. When you click the share button, there is an option to “recommend” an article with commentary, which seems to only be visible when you interact with the share button. There also is only a search bar visible when you navigate to the “saves” tab, rather than being visible at any point of navigation (through home, discover, or collections). **Severity rating: 2.**

**Heuristic #7:** *Flexibility and efficiency of use.* You cannot favorite newly-saved articles from the discovery page, you must navigate back to saved articles from discovery, once saved, to favorite said articles. However, on the “get help” section that appears when you navigate to your account icon, you can learn about keyboard shortcuts for navigating through the website application. **Severity rating: 2.**

**Heuristic #8:** *Aesthetic and minimalist design.* When navigating through the “saves” tab, there is a navigation bar on the left-hand side that lists out the four main tabs, as well as filters and tags. As throughout website navigation, the four main tabs are visible at the top of the website platform, the navigation bar with the four main tabs is redundant and unnecessary. **Severity rating: 1.**

**Heuristic #9:** *Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.* There seems to be few errors you can make on the application. Any major action is accompanied by a notification in green alerting you of your action. **Severity rating: 0.**

**Heuristic #10:** *Help and documentation.* When you navigate to your icon, you can click on a “get help” tab that has instructions based on how you are using the application. This includes getting started on your device, tagging, bulk editing, and every action you can perform on the platform. **Severity rating: 0.**

## Website #2: [SeeLink](https://www.seelink.app/)

![A screenshot of the webpage SeeLink, an application designed for collaborative link-sharing](https://github.com/aergithub/HeuristicsEvaluationDH110/blob/8279334f47d4d2c38db5dc4d7bd9554cbf1f1417/Screen%20Shot%202023-04-11%20at%204.10.45%20AM.png)

**Brief description:** This is the website of a web and mobile application “SeeLink” that allows users to save and share links through collaborative boards. It brands itself as the first link sharing and collaboration platform to be used between teams, friends, families, and communities. There are two main pages: account and home, in which you can share and tag links, navigate through your saved links and boards, and see what boards have been shared with you. 

**Overall evaluation:** he website is rudimentary at best and has a lot of room for improvement to make it visibly appealing and easy to navigate and organize your uploads. One of the biggest concerns is that you can only view your four most recently uploaded links in a visual format, and that there is no place to navigate to see everything you’ve uploaded. The same goes for any saved links, as well. 

## Heuristic Evaluation

**Heuristic #1:** *Visibility of system status.* There seems to be a lack of a status update when you upload a link to your profile. Rather than a notification or pop-up that lets you know the link has been uploaded, the page refreshes. Only when you scroll down to the section titled “My Links” do you get confirmation that your link has been saved to your profile. **Severity rating: 3.**

**Heuristic #2:** *Match between system and the real world.* Each action you can take on the website is articulated by a word or symbol that is easily understood and relatable to said action. The website logo is a chain link, a symbol used for URLs; the main page to share links is accompanied by a question to tag the post or share the post with a board; tags, owners, and the option to bookmark/save the link is available on the link’s icon. **Severity rating: 1.**

**Heuristic #3:** *User control and freedom.* It seems that when a link has already been added to the section “my links” without being added to a board, it cannot be added to a board without being re-uploaded. **Severity rating: 3.**

**Heuristic #4:** *Consistency and standards.* Rather than incorporating visible menu options or a navigation bar as you typically would see, your organized links (through sections entitled “My Links,” “My Boards,” “Shared with Me,” and “Saved”) are visible only when you scroll down from the screen that asks “What do you want to share today?” Additionally, when you navigate to the profile icon to see a section entitled “My Account,” you only see statistics of the number of links added, boards created, and boards shared with you. You do not see the number of links shared, nor are you able to view a collection of these links/boards. This differs from the home page, as it incorporates visual icons for each link/board. **Severity rating: 3.** 

**Heuristic #5:** *Error prevention.* Given the inability to review any links uploaded outside of the four most recently uploaded/saved, or those added to a board, there should be a confirmation that you want to upload a link without any tags or being shared to a board, that way the user is aware their action is resulting in them (1) not being able to save the already uploaded link to a board but also (2) not being able to find said link after additional uploads unless there is a recollection of the links’ title. **Severity rating: 2.**

**Heuristic #6:** *Recognition rather than recall.* Under the “My Links” section visible on the home page, only the four most recently added links are visible. Other than that, there seems to be no place to view all of your added links, unless they were shared with a board. **Severity rating: 3.**

**Heuristic #7:** *Flexibility and efficiency of use.* The application is quite simplistic and does not seem to have any particular shortcuts nor is there a help section to reveal any helpful courses of actions in regards to site navigation. **Severity rating: 2.** 

**Heuristic #8:** *Aesthetic and minimalist design.* The website has a focused purpose and therefore has little beyond the absolute necessary to navigate the site. **Severity rating: 0.**

**Heuristic #9:** *Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.* Any action to delete a board, pin, or account enables a pop-up that asks if you’re certain you want to commit said action. The button indicating that you want to follow through the action is in bright red. **Severity rating: 0.** 

**Heuristic #10:** *Help and documentation.* There is no FAQ, help center, or contact information for the website. The user is then subjected to try and figure out whatever issue they may have trouble with on their own. **Severity rating: 3.**
