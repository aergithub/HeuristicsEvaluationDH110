# UX Design of Content-Sharing Applications

## Andrea Robinson, DH 110: User Experience and Design

Project Description: I am conducting a heuristic evaluation of two websites designed for information storing and sharing. My project is aimed to connect generations through the information they consume: the videos they watch, the music they listen to, the articles they read. The purpose of the application is for those within a selected community, family, or group to be able to share the content they're engaging with without having to directly inform each person.
